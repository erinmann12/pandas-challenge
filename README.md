# pandas-challenge

**Background**

For this project, I was tasked with analyzing the data for a fictional independent gaming company for their recent game Heroes of Pymoli. The game is free-to-play, but players have the option to purchase items within the game to enhance their playing experience. I generated a report for this project that broke down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights. 

**Tools Used**

1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Jupyter Notebook

**Project Tasks**

This project was broken up into eight sections of the report. I started by importing the csv file and storing in a data frame. Next, I created two separate data frames for the player data and the purchase data for easy recall later.

In the player count section, I calculated the total number of players and displayed in in a data frame. Next, I calculated the total number of unique items, average purchase price, total number of purchases, and total revenue to display in a data frame. Using the player data data frame, I calculated the percentage and count of male, female, and non-disclosed players.  I then calculated the purchase count, average purchase price, total purchase value, and average purchase total per person and separated the statistics by gender. Next, I used bins to calculate the purchase count, average purchase price, total purchase value ,and average purchase total per person and separated the statistics by age.

I then calculated the top five spenders in the game and displayed their screen name, purchase count, average purchase price, and total purchase value in a data frame. I also calculated the top five most popular items by purchase count and displayed their item ID, item name, purchase count, item price, and total purchase value in a data frame.

Finally, I calculated the top five most profitable items by total purchase value and displayed their purchase statistics in a data frame.
